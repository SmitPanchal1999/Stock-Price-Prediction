#Stock Price Prediction
This paper delves into the realm of stock price prediction within the constraints of the efficient market hypothesis, employing two distinct models: the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Focused on historical market data for Apple, Google, and Tesla, the study independently develops both ARIMA and LSTM models to forecast closing stock values. The objective is a straightforward comparison of the results derived from each model. By evaluating the RMSE and MAPE values of ARIMA and LSTM, this paper aims to provide insights into the distinct forecasting capabilities of these methodologies. The findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of the predictive performance of ARIMA and LSTM models in the context of stock price dynamics.
